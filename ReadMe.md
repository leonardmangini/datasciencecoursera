Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains the final project for the Coursera Course Getting and Cleaning Data

It contains:

- an R script that transforms this into a tidy data set tidy_data.txt
- a CodeBook.md markdown file which describes how the R script works
- the file tidy_data.txt that was produced from the R script.

It assumes:

- you have downloaded the zip file to your working directory
- unzipped the zip file which creates /test and /training subdirectories in the working directory
- you do NOT rename these subdirectories before running the R script
- you run the R script in R Studio
